May 14-16

 “Celebrate the spirit of community and build something awesome for small businesses and local groups with this hackathon. This is your cue to do something for your neighborhood and think about the problems they face. Create innovative hacks that empower them to do more!”

Proposal: Club Budget & Member Managing App

Motivation:
School clubs have sometimes difficulty managing budgets for various activities, especially if the club has a monthly membership fee. An application that can act as a ledger for those clubs and a list of active members at the same time will help with this problem.

Description:
Application for a small group that manages its fundings and expenses. Manager (or someone responsible for the finance of the group) can easily add funding for the month, keep a list of the members and manage membership for each member (membership fee is automatically added to the month’s funding), deduct funds for expenses, and see how much remaining funding the group has each month.

Needed Features:
Simple Ledger (earned money through budget, membership fee, etc. and expenses)
List of members (past and present) and active members

Things to ask:
Managed by one (easier) or many (harder)?
How to store relevant data: text file (easiest), database (bit harder), or cloud storage (bit harder + cost money but fancy)
Type of application: webpage (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React), mobile app (Android Studio), desktop app (Python or Java Third-Party Library), or else.
Language choice (Java? Python? JavaScript/TypeScript? C++?)
