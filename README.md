## ‚úèÔ∏è Proposal: Club Budget & Member Managing App  

#### Motivation:
School clubs have sometimes difficulty managing budgets for various activities, especially if the club has a monthly membership fee. An application that can act as a ledger for those clubs and a list of active members at the same time will help with this problem.  

#### Description:
Application for a small group that manages its fundings and expenses. Manager (or someone responsible for the finance of the group) can easily add funding for the month, keep a list of the members and manage membership for each member (membership fee is automatically added to the month‚Äôs funding), deduct funds for expenses, and see how much remaining funding the group has each month.
